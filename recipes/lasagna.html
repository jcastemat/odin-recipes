        <li>500g ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the noodles:</strong> Boil lasagna noodles in salted water until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the sauce:</strong> In a pan, heat olive oil and sauté the onion and garlic. Add ground beef and cook until browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, salt, and pepper. Let simmer for 15–20 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the layers:</strong> In a baking dish, start with a thin layer of sauce. Then layer: noodles → meat sauce → mozzarella. Repeat until ingredients are used, ending with sauce and mozzarella on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Cover with foil and bake at 180°C (350°F) for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake for 10–15 more minutes until bubbly and golden. Let it rest for about  15 minutes and enjoy!</li>
